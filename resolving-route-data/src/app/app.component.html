<h2>Angular 2 demo: Route resolver class</h2>
    
<p>In this demo, our route resolver is a class with a <code>resolve()</code> method. Note how we use the same class as a provider token,
as well as the resolver configuration on the routes. Also, note how the navigation is delayed by 3 seconds.</p>
